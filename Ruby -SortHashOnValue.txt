def solution(array, key)
    array.sort_by!{ |e| e.values }
end


- sort the array by the value stored at in each mini-hash.

def solution(array, key)
  array.sort_by {|a| a[key]}
end

- this uses the input ‘key’ variable.
  - if test cases might have given a hash with a different key, and this would control for it.
