Description:

The marketing team are spending way too much time typing in hashtags.
Let's help them with out own Hashtag Generator!

Here's the deal:

If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return false.
If the input is a empty string it must return false.
It must start with a hashtag (#).
All words must have their first letter capitalized.
Example Input to Output:

" Hello there thanks for trying my Kata" => "#HelloThereThanksForTryingMyKata"

" Hello World " => "#HelloWorld"

def generateHashtag(str)
  str.empty? || str.gsub(" ","").length+1>140 ? false : "#"+str.split(" ").map {|n| n.capitalize}.join()
end

- First check to see if string is empty or greater than 140 chars (after empty spaces removed)
  - return false if either of those are true
- Then add a “#” to the front, split on spaces, capitalize each letter, join without spaces
