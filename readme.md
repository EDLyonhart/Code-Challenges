I am collecting code challenges.

I am pulling from CodeWars.com, friends, coding meetups, standard interview questions and anywhere else I can find good code challenges.

For each one I start by identifying the problem.
Secondly I write my solution.
Then I explain my solution in as basic a terms as seems prudent

Afterwards, I'll copy other solutions with different types of solutions and explain what I see going on in each of them.




I want to stretch the boundaries of what I can do. Completing challenges is one way, but seeing how others work through problems is just as helpful
