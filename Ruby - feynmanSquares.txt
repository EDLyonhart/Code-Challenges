in a grid with ’n’ elements, how many squares can you make?

def count_squares(n)
    total = 0
    n.times do
        total = total + n**2
        n-=1
    end
    total
end


- - - - - alt - - - - -

def count_squares(n)
  n == 1 ? 1 : (n * n) + count_squares(n - 1);
end



this is the recursive answer.
