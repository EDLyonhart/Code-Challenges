Write a rotate function that rotates a two-dimensional array (a matrix) either clockwise or anti-clockwise by 90 degrees, and returns the rotated array.

The function accepts two parameters: an array, and a string specifying the direction or rotation. The direction will be either "clockwise" or "counter-clockwise".

def rotate matrix, direction
    newMatrix, i = [], 0
    (matrix.length).times do
        matrix.map { |row| newMatrix << row[i] }
        i+=1
    end
    direction == 'clockwise' ? 
        newMatrix.each_slice(matrix.length).to_a.map { |newRow| newRow.reverse} :
        newMatrix.each_slice(matrix.length).to_a.reverse
end


- start with initializing a ‘answer array’ and an index-counter
- we’re going to look at index ‘i’ of each row and push it into the answer array
- each pass through will only look at index ‘0’ or ‘1’ or ‘2’ ... etc pushing those items in sequentially.
- increment ‘i’ up one with each complete pass.

^^^ (this has the function of switching ‘rows’ with ‘columns’) ^^^

- if direction was ‘clockwise’ the answer array needs to be broken up into the original size rows (using ‘.each_slice’)
  - then reverse each row-array to correctly position each element
- else if direction was ‘counter-clockwise’ we reverse the position of each row.
